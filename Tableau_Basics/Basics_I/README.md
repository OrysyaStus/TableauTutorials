# Basics I: From Data to Functional Dashboard
Tableau is a software which produces interactive visualization products. We will be going through a Tableau workflow which includes, but is not limited to, examining data, creating a data connection with Tableau, creating a couple of simple visualizations (ie. bar charts, geospatial analysis, etc.), developing a dashboard, and publishing the developed dashboard to Tableau public. 

This tutorial will be using the following work https://sandiegohearts.github.io/

We will be developing the following dashboard

## Data Exploration: All_Data_Into_Tableau.xlsx
Examine the factors contributing to varying heart disease rates across San Diego and recommend ways to bring down the rates in the high risk areas. Help the potential users to make better decisions to run the campaigns and channelize the funds to the right regions.

## Make the Data Connection

For this tutorial, we will be using 2 sheets from the All_Data_Into_Tableau.xlsx file with the proper fields joined, SanDiegoZipCodes (LiveWell_Regions) and CHDDeathsDischargesHospital (Geography).
